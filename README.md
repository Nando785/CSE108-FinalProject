# CSE108 - FinalProject

## 📌 Final Project – Full Stack Web Application

### 📖 Overview
This repository contains the source code for our Final Project submission for a Full Stack Web Development course at the University of California Merced. This project represents a culmination of the knowledge and technical skills we've developed throughout the semester in web development. Rather than taking a traditional written exam, students are tasked with showcasing their abilities through the design, implementation, and live demonstration of a fully functional and hosted web application.

The final project is worth 35% of the total course grade and is intended to replace the final exam.

### 👥 Team Structure
Students are encouraged to work in teams of 3 or 4 members, and group members do not need to be enrolled in the same lab section. Collaboration is essential, and teams are expected to coordinate effectively to distribute responsibilities across the backend, frontend, and database components of the project.

### 🎯 Project Requirements
To meet the minimum requirements for this final project, your submission must include the following elements:

1) 🔗 Substantial Web Application
The project must be more in-depth and complex than previous labs, especially Lab 8.

2) 🌐 Live Hosting
The web application must be hosted on the web and accessible via a public URL.

3) 💾 Backend + Database Integration
The application must have a fully functional backend and use a persistent database to store and retrieve user or app data.

4) 🔐 User Authentication
Your app must implement user registration and login functionality, using hashed and salted passwords to secure user credentials.

5) 👩‍💻 Frontend Interface
The application must have a working and polished frontend that allows users to interact with the app's main features intuitively.

6) 🧠 Creativity & Technical Challenge
Students are encouraged to go beyond the basic functionality and build something innovative, engaging, and technically impressive. Extra attention should be given to user experience, code organization, scalability, and real-world usability.
